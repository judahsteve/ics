# ics
To use ICS in your project
include the ics.js file 
and create a custom ics tag where all ics instructions will be written

Example provided below
<script type = "text/javascript" src = "ics2u.js"></script>
<script type = "text/ics">
    ICS Codes go here
</script>

An example Sudoku Sovler project that was created entirely using ICS can be found here
